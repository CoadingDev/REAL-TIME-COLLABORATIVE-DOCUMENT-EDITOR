# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :
During my internship at CODTECH, I developed a project called SmartNotes, a real-time collaborative document editor that allows multiple users to create and edit documents simultaneously. The main goal of this project was to provide an interactive platform where users can collaborate on notes or content in real time, making it easier for teams, students, or professionals to work together remotely.

I used ReactJS for the frontend to build a dynamic and user-friendly interface. The real-time text editing feature updates the content instantly across all active users, so everyone sees the latest changes without refreshing the page. The interface was designed to be clean and minimal for ease of use, with support for features like live typing indicators and shared document access.

The backend was developed using Python, where I implemented WebSocket connections to handle real-time communication between users. This ensured that all edits made by one user were reflected immediately to others working on the same document. I also integrated user authentication so that only authorized users could create or access specific documents, ensuring privacy and security.

For storing user data and documents, I used MongoDB, a NoSQL database that helped manage unstructured content like document versions, user permissions, and session information. MongoDBâ€™s flexibility made it easy to track and store collaborative changes efficiently.

This project helped me understand how full-stack applications work, especially those that require real-time capabilities. I learned how to connect the frontend and backend using WebSockets and how to manage data flow efficiently in a collaborative environment. Working on SmartNoted not only improved my coding skills but also gave me practical experience in building scalable and interactive web applications.
