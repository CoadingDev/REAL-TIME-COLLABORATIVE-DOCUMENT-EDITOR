# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED :
During my internship at CODTECH, I built this project where the name of the project is SmartNotes, a real-time collaborative document editor that I independently designed and developed to explore how real-time applications function. The idea behind SmartNoted was to build a simple and interactive platform where multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously, with instant updates across all connected clients.

I used ReactJS to develop the frontend, allowing for a smooth and dynamic user interface. The layout includes real-time text editing, cursor presence, and typing indicators so users can collaborate efficiently. React’s component-based architecture made it easier to manage complex UI features while keeping the interface responsive and user-friendly.

For the backend, I used Python, where I implemented WebSocket connections to handle two-way real-time communication. This allowed users to see changes made by others instantly, without needing to refresh the page. I also created secure API routes and user authentication so that only authorized users could access or edit documents.

The database for this project was built using MongoDB, which helped in managing document content, user data, and collaboration history. MongoDB’s flexible document structure made it easy to store different versions of a document and track changes over time. It also supported efficient data retrieval for quick loading and saving of documents.

Working on SmartNotes helped me understand the complexities involved in real-time data syncing, concurrency management, and full-stack application development. I also learned how to handle real-time conflicts, structure collaborative data, and create a scalable system that supports multiple users working simultaneously. Although this was not a team project assigned by CODTECH, it was something I took initiative on during my internship period to strengthen my practical knowledge in web development.

This project played a crucial role in enhancing my coding skills and deepening my understanding of both frontend and backend technologies in a real-world scenario.
